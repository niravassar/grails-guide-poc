Database migrations are schema changes to the database while preserving the existing data.
Without a tool to manage database migrations, teams may rely on manual sql, error prone communication processes, and
costly risk management to implement solutions. The database migration plugin lets you manage structural changes made to the database.
It automates incremental changes, makes them repeatable, visible and trackable. You can commit these changes in to source control.

The general workflow involved in using the plugin is as follow:

*Baseline*

1. Define the current state of the domain
2. Create the database from the changelog using liquibase
3. Set configuration options in the application to use the database migration plugin

*Development Workflow*

1. Make changes to domain objects
2. Use the plugin to generate changelog additions for the database
3. Update the database using the plugin
