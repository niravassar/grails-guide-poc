To summarize this guide, we learned how use the database migration plugin to change column names, add columns, and potentially
redesign tables while migration existing data. It is important to note that database migration consists of a typical workflow:

1. Make changes to Domain objects.
2. Generate the changelog which will identify database structure differences between the existing database and the edited
domain objects.
3. Consider any existing data to migrate.
4. Execute the database migration scripts.
